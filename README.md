# Rttf2pt1

The Rttf2p1 package for R is meant to be used with the extrafont package.
It is in its own package for licensing reasons.

This package contains the source code for the utility program `ttf2pt1`.
It will be compiled on installation, so you need a build environment on your system (unless you install fonts as a precompiled package from CRAN).

# Licensing notes

This product includes software developed by the TTF2PT1 Project and its contributors.
